# SpamFilter
The SMS Spam Collection is a set of SMS tagged messages that have been collected for SMS Spam research. It contains one set of SMS messages in English of 5,572 messages, tagged acording being ham (legitimate) or spam. 
In this example I have used Naive Bayes to solve the problem.
A little pre-processing has gone into the data like changing all the text to lower-case, removing punctuations and stop words. I have used sklearn library to do implement these.
